Sure, let's break down the expression `return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;`:

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Binary Representation**:
   - In binary, powers of 2 have a single `1` bit followed by `0` bits.
     - For example:
       - \(2^0 = 1\) in binary is `0001`
       - \(2^1 = 2\) in binary is `0010`
       - \(2^2 = 4\) in binary is `0100`
       - \(2^3 = 8\) in binary is `1000`

2. **Bitwise AND Operation**:
   - The bitwise AND operator `&` compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if both bits are `1`, otherwise it returns `0`.

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - **n**: Let's consider `n = 4` (which is `0100` in binary).
   - **n - 1**: For `n = 4`, `n - 1 = 3` (which is `0011` in binary).
   - **n & (n - 1)**:
     - `4 (0100)` AND `3 (0011)` results in `0000`.

4. **Why `(n & (n - 1)) == 0`?**:
   - If `n` is a power of 2:
     - It has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation.
     - `n - 1` will have all the bits flipped to the right of the single `1` bit in `n`.
     - When performing `n & (n - 1)`, all bits will be `0` because there will be no `1` bits in the same positions.
   - If `n` is NOT a power of 2:
     - There will be more than one `1` bit in its binary representation.
     - Performing `n & (n - 1)` will not result in `0`.

### Examples:
- **Power of 2 (Example: 8)**
  - `n = 8` (Binary: `1000`)
  - `n - 1 = 7` (Binary: `0111`)
  - `n & (n - 1) = 8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0000` (True, so 8 is a power of 2)

- **Not a Power of 2 (Example: 10)**
  - `n = 10` (Binary: `1010`)
  - `n - 1 = 9` (Binary: `1001`)
  - `n & (n - 1) = 10 & 9 = 1010 & 1001 = 1000` (False, so 10 is not a power of 2)

### Conclusion:
The expression `return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;` is a clever way to check if a number `n` is a power of 2 by using binary arithmetic properties. This method is efficient because it operates in constant time \(O(1)\).

This expression is another way to determine if a given number \( n \) is a power of 2. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

### Breakdown:

1. **Logarithms**:
   - `Math.log(n)`: Computes the natural logarithm (base \( e \)) of \( n \).
   - `Math.log(2)`: Computes the natural logarithm (base \( e \)) of 2.

2. **Division**:
   - `Math.log(n) / Math.log(2)`: Computes the logarithm of \( n \) to the base 2, since \( \log_b(a) = \frac{\log_c(a)}{\log_c(b)} \). In this case, it determines what power 2 must be raised to, to obtain \( n \).

3. **Ceil and Floor**:
   - `Math.ceil(...)`: Rounds up to the nearest integer.
   - `Math.floor(...)`: Rounds down to the nearest integer.

4. **Casting to int**:
   - The `ceil` and `floor` values are cast to integers, which removes any decimal part and makes a direct comparison possible.

### Full Expression:


return (int)(Math.ceil((Math.log(n) / Math.log(2))))
            == (int)(Math.floor(
                ((Math.log(n) / Math.log(2)))));


### Explanation:
- **If \( n \) is a power of 2**:
  - The result of \( \log_2(n) \) will be an integer. For example, \( \log_2(8) = 3 \) since \( 2^3 = 8 \).
  - When you apply `ceil` and `floor` to an integer, both will return the same integer.
  - Therefore, \( \text{ceil}(\log_2(n)) \) will equal \( \text{floor}(\log_2(n)) \).

- **If \( n \) is NOT a power of 2**:
  - The result of \( \log_2(n) \) will be a non-integer. For example, \( \log_2(10) \approx 3.32193 \).
  - The `ceil` of a non-integer will round up to the next integer (e.g., \( \text{ceil}(3.32193) = 4 \)).
  - The `floor` of a non-integer will round down to the previous integer (e.g., \( \text{floor}(3.32193) = 3 \)).
  - Therefore, \( \text{ceil}(\log_2(n)) \) will not equal \( \text{floor}(\log_2(n)) \).

### Conclusion:
This expression effectively checks whether \( n \) is a power of 2 by comparing the integer parts of the `ceil` and `floor` of its logarithm base 2. If they are equal, \( n \) is a power of 2; otherwise, it is not.
